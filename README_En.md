# ClassTap  
*A cleaner, simpler sticky-note style web app for homework tracking.*

## Features  
1. Add cards freely  
2. Sticky-note–style visual cards  
3. Subject-labeled assignment cards  
4. Real-time clock cards  
5. Android-like drag-and-drop reordering (via [SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/))  
6. Auto-expanding cards when content grows  

## Tech Stack  
Pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript — **no backend**, lightweight & offline-first.

## i18n  
Currently only Simplified Chinese (`lang/zh-CN.js`).  
**PRs for other languages are warmly welcome!**

## Run Locally  
Just clone and open `index.html` in your browser. For development, we recommend [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (though no network requests are made).

## Privacy & Data  
All data is saved in `localStorage` — persistent across refreshes, but **strictly local**:  
✅ Never uploaded  
✅ No tracking  
✅ Zero third-party scripts (no analytics, ads, or beacons)  
*(Optional multi-device sync may come later — but local-only mode will always be supported.)*
